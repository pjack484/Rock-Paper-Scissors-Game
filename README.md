# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
Used Python to create a really neat Rock, paper, scissors game that you play with the computers AI.  Two versions here, one with a continuous loop the other version without.  Both are pretty cool.

You tell the computer if you want Rock Paper or Scissors, the computer then randomly makes its own selection of Rock Paper and Scissors.  The looped version can go on continuously the other version stops after someone wins.
